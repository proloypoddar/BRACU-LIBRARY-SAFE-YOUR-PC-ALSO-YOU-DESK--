## Hey BRACU Pips!

Looking for the ultimate guardian for your library desk? Tired of worrying about your laptop’s safety when you just need to answer nature’s call? Worry no more!

Introducing the **PC Safety Monitor**, your personal desk protector. This smart system will:  
- Snap real-time pictures if anyone gets too cozy with your PC.  
- Show off a custom message you set (because why not let your personality shine?).  
- Countdown with a timer to remind the world you're coming back soon.  
- When time’s up, display your emergency contact info in style (and maybe freak out the intruder with your level of preparation).

### Features:
- **Face Detection Magic**: Detects faces like a pro (even without a fancy GPU).  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the camera feed as it captures any unexpected guests.  
- **Custom Messages**: Add your unique flair with personalized messages displayed on the screen.  
- **Snap and Save**: Photos of the intruder are saved for you to view later (and maybe show them who's boss).  
- **Timeout Blackout**: When your timer ends, a slick black screen displays your emergency contact and a predefined image (QR codes, memes, or anything you fancy!).

### How to Use:
1. Run the app on your laptop.  
2. Enter your custom message and the timer duration.  
3. Hit **Start Monitoring** and leave confidently.  
4. Return to your laptop, knowing you’ve got photos of anyone who dared to trespass.

So go ahead, install this, and enjoy the peace of mind that your PC (and your desk) are in safe hands!
